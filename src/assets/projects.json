I've written poetry for years, and when faced with this task I decided to turn the story into a series of poems starting from early childhood to my positive outlook on life now. After many nights writing I finally had a draft and upon reading it made the bold decision to publish it for anyone to see. I aquired and ISBN Number and started the work of publishing through Barnes & Nobel Press. I am currently waiting on my Author's copy and once I have reviewed the print quality I plan on approving the design and listing it for sale on Barnes & Nobel, Amazon, and donating a few copies to some local libraries here in Seattle. Once the item is listed I will place a link to my author profile in the top with the Github, Spotify, etc links as well as in this section here..",
