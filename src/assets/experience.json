Expanding support coverage from 5x10 to 7x24, implementing new hire training & onboarding resources. I authored the initial support runbooks and troubleshooting documentation by analyzing sourcecode and extrapolating points of failure and custom commands from the product. I also served as the \"Support Program Manager\" and Jira Administrator/Architect implementing and desiging the companies Atlassian Products. I developed a standalone Laravel application for support account management and collaborated with Product Management and Engineering for an MVP that would later be rewritten in TypeScript, React, and Go using gRPC to connect with existing infrastructure. I also assisted the Director with the implementation of Tableau as the primary data analysis tool, desiging and implementing initial data flows. With that I helped automate the weekly customer reports taking the manual creation time of over 8+ hours a week to just under 1 hour for review.",
